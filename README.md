### Wallet Credit Scoring



This project utilizes a rule-based scoring mechanism to quantify wallet-level creditworthiness in the Compound V2 system.



#### Data Collection



* **Source:** V2 Compound user activity aggregated data, presumably from on-chain data indexed via Flipside, Dune, or custom scraping.
* Derived key transactional activity and protocol-specific measurements by wallet.





#### Feature Selection Reasoning



The following attributes were chosen based on their ability to signal wallet behavior, reliability, and protocol behavior:



* ***compound\_tx\_count***: Number of Compound interactions
* ***borrow\_count***: Number of borrow transactions
* ***repay\_count***: Repay transaction count
* ***enter\_markets\_count***: Number of markets entered (diversification)
* ***unique\_ctokens***: tokens used count
* ***error\_tx\_count***: Failed/error transactions (indicator of risk)
* ***gas\_used***: Activity level proxy
* ***first\_activity\_days\_ago***: Wallet age (protocol seniority)





#### Scoring Method



1. **Normalization**: All the features normalized using Min-Max normalization.
2. **Weighting**: Heuristic weights reflecting relative contribution to risk:
3. Positive values for good behavior (e.g., repay\_count, gas usage)
4. Negative weight for risk (e.g., error\_tx\_count)
5. **Aggregation**: Weighted sum was calculated and scaled to a range of 0â€“1000.
6. **Final Score**: Rounded integer between 0 and 1000 indicating wallet trustworthiness.





#### Risk Indicator Rationale



| Feature                   | Weight | Reason                                  |
|---------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| `compound_tx_count`       | +0.20  | More activity = more trust               |
| `borrow_count`            | +0.20  | Indicates credit usage                   |
| `repay_count`             | +0.15  | Repayment behavior = lower risk          |
| `enter_markets_count`     | +0.10  | Shows protocol engagement                |
| `unique_ctokens`          | +0.10  | Token diversity = financial maturity     |
| `error_tx_count`          | -0.05  | Failed transactions = operational risk   |
| `gas_used`                | +0.10  | Indicates participation effort           |
| `first_activity_days_ago` | +0.10  | Older wallets are usually more reliable  |



#### Scalability



* Simple to extend to Aave, Compound V3, or other lending protocols.
* Framework can be replaced by ML/XGBoost model if labeled data is available.
* Rule-based scores ensure transparency and explainability.
